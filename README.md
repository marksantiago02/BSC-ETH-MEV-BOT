# BSC/ETH MEV Bot

A high-performance MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) bot engineered for Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain networks. This sophisticated trading system captures value through advanced arbitrage detection, sandwich attacks, and transaction backrunning strategies.

## Overview

This MEV bot implements cutting-edge algorithms to identify and execute profitable opportunities across multiple DEXs and protocols. Built with Rust for maximum performance, it processes millions of calculations per second to find optimal arbitrage cycles and execute complex trading strategies.

### Key Capabilities

- **Multi-Strategy Execution**: Combines sandwich attacks with arbitrage in single transactions, with fallback mechanisms
- **Flash Loan Integration**: Minimizes capital requirements through flash loans and flash swaps
- **Real-time Analysis**: Processes mempool transactions with microsecond precision
- **Advanced Path Finding**: Graph-based algorithms discover optimal multi-hop arbitrage routes
